    # 12. ereq [LF..]: request errors. Some of the possible causes
    # are:
    #     - early termination from the client, before the request has
    #       been sent.
    #     - read error from the client
    #     - client timeout

    # trying to connect to a backend server. The backend stat is the
    # sum of the stat for all servers of that backend, plus any
    # connection errors not associated with a particular server (such
    # as the backend having no active servers).
    'eresp',
    # 14. eresp [..BS]: response errors. srv_abrt will be counted here
    # also.
    # Some other errors are:
    #     - write error on the client socket (won't be counted for the
    #       server stat)
    #     - failure applying filters to the response.
    'wretr',
    # 15. wretr [..BS]: number of times a connection to a server was
    # retried.
    'wredis',
    # 16. wredis [..BS]: number of times a request was redispatched to
    # another server. The server value counts the number of times that
    # server was switched away from.
